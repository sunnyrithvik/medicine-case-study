      "How I wish my insurance would still cover this, even if it was at tier 3 and cost me $200 a prescription. Prior to starting on this I would go 4-5 days without sleep. I'm not talking fitful sleep where I would toss and turn, but 4-5 days awake for the entire 24 hours of the day. There is a reason sleep deprivation is a torture method. It is horrid. Ambien changed my life. I would take one, then I would have about 15 minutes to get to where I was sleeping. I would close my eyes and not open them for 8 hours. The only drawback is that it is an amnestic, so it may be that you get up at night and do some stuff, like raid the fridge, and not remember. It is also a bit of a truth serum in that you find yourself talking before you think about what you're saying. Best way to handle that is to take it when you get into bed. If your insurance covers this, or if you have the means, insist on this rather than generic zolpidem. I've heard professionals swear that generics are equivalent to brand names, but they are not in my experience. The effect and time for delivery is vastly varied depending on which generic manufacturer you are using. I have found some to have no little to no effect. Maybe it's just me.Read More Read Less  \n",

      "Name brand Ambien works great. No waking side effects and doesn't linger in system. However, if you are going to take generic equivalent Zopidem, please read the following: I have to cut generic Zolpidem pill in half, sometimes thirds, because full pill turns me into a useless zombie following day. I take 15 minutes before laying down, gets me to sleep and only wake 2-3 times during sleep, mainly to readjust position. Dream well. However, even with just half a pill, I can't get myself out of bed for about 10-12 hours, I experience severe vertigo for 1-3 hours accompanied by 4-5 hours of dopiness, and experience a near total loss of meaningful cognitive function and any motivation to get anything done. Zolpidem (generic) is NOT to be compared to Ambien, as Ambien has none of these awful side effects. Sadly, the existence of Zolpidem and price-gouging in the US has prevented insurance coverage for Ambien and purchase of Ambien for the millions of us without insurance. Zolpidem is not safe, for hours after waking up I am still unable to drive without being under the influence. FDA should take this drug off the US market. In the meantime, it would be much safer and productive, sadly, to live with chronic insomnia.Read More Read Less  \n",

This can be fought with a good attorney if you plead the Ambien defense. Meaning, you did not knowingly and with malice get in your car and drive... I would also get up and make bon-fires, cook food, clean the house, and take more ambiens and not understand why my medication kept coming up short. I put my family through such a hard time because they were up trying to watch me and finally told me after the driving incident what I had been doing. It upset me terribly.

      "At first use of Ambien it felt like being a little bit drunk but it also felt very relaxing like getting into a hot tub.   Within a couple days I was hooked and looked forward to the time of day when I could take my Ambien and relax.    It didn't put me to sleep,  just made me feel very relaxed and comfortable.    Within a couple of months I actually tried to stop taking the Ambien.  Right away I had horrible panic attacks and ran back to the Ambien.  I thought I couldn't stop using it daily or I would have a nervous breakdown.   A year and a half went by and I kept using the Ambien.    I got extremely active on my new job and wanted to lose weight so I started eating less. All of the sudden without warning I had a full on nervous breakdown.  Two weeks in a row it happened.  I felt like my body had metabolized the Ambien due to my increased activity.   I went to the ER and begged for help during the second nervous breakdown episode.  I was hallucinating and I didn't know who the president was.    They put me into a mental hospital for 5 days and doped me up so I wouldn't have a seizure coming off the Ambien cold turkey.   I continued to be extremely sick for 7 weeks.  I could not go to work or watch tv or listen to music or anything.  I suffered night and day refusing to take anything other than over the counter sedatives.  It was absolutely horrible.  I found comfort in ASMR and videos on withdrawal that other people had put on YouTube.   If I went anywhere I felt the need to stay by the door in case I had a panic attack and had to run out to my car.  The doctors were keeping me confused by telling me that I was manifesting PTSD. I am fully convinced that it was all the Ambien.  I do not recommend Ambien.  I wish I had never tried it in the first place but it was given to me like it was not that big of a deal.

Often feel drowsy the next morning. I fell getting out of bed and landed on my back the other night. I don't remember the fall (my wife told me). I have started to cut the pills in half to slowly get off the ambien. 5 MG still helps me get to sleep now and I hope to get completely off it.\n",

      "This was prescribed as I was simultaneously going through a divorce and menopause,  immediately followed by diagnosis of kidney cancer and a nephrectomy.  Love, Health, Money; entire life in a turmoil.  At first, it was as needed, and then I needed it every night.  I now take 10 mg nightly.  Most nights, I sleep straight through 8 hours and wake refreshed and...pleasant as opposed to snarly.  I feel well rested.  It's been over a decade now and this drug works for me every single night, every time.  I am dependent on it.    There is a routine that needs to be followed (for me).  Brush teeth, wash face, get pajamas on, get my favorite book and curl up in bed.  No binge eating, sleep walking or (heaven forbid) sleep driving.  I prefer to call this dependence rather than addiction and perhaps that is just semantics.  I am unable to fall asleep without this drug.  I have never  abused it; I simply follow directions and take it as prescribed.  For me, this drug has meant the difference between tossing and turning all night long to at least 7-8 hours of restful sleep.  Read More Read Less  \n",

I have concerns about being in it for this long and concerns about reports if an increased risk of dementia as I get older. Melatonin does not work for me. Trazadone made me nauseous and dizzy. I would like to lower my dose back to the 10mg and see if I can wean off and try something else. But overall, Ambien is amazing if you can't sleep.\n",

It does it job in helping me go to sleep which is wonderful, but I do what my dr. calls: \"Ambien shopping\" and this is the 1st time he's heard of it. I never wear jewelry except my wedding ring, but when I take Ambien I will get up in the middle of the night, get on the internet and buy jewelry; a LOT of jewelry. I don't realize what I've done until the UPS man shows up at my door with my packages. At least I look for 'Sales\" and \"closeouts\".

Without it, I cannot sleep at all while crammed into that seat on an airplane in coach.  With one 5 mg tablet I can sleep 3-5 hours, which is much better than going without sleep for a total of 36 hours.  I don't feel groggy; and I have enough energy to go sightseeing all day after arriving.  I have not yet experienced any side effects, no sleepwalking, no memory loss, no mind fog.

All these side effects are in the fine print that no one reads, of course.  I stopped taking it cold turkey after I found out about the ulcers.  Detoxing was not pleasant.  I'll never take another.

Thinking about increasing it to 15 just to see if it will help. Just wondering what the maximum dose is. I don't take any other prescription meds, just a lot of vitamins, minerals (including magnesium which is supposed to help with sleep)and herbal teas.
