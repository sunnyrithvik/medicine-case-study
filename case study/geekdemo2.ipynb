However, it was recommended about 3 years ago to get off of it, I don't remember why. Now the Ambien... the prescribed 5 mg doesn't work, nor does increasing it to 10 mg. Thinking about increasing it to 15 just to see if it will help. Just wondering what the maximum dose is. I don't take any other prescription meds, just a lot of vitamins, minerals (including magnesium which is supposed to help with sleep)and herbal teas. Someone suggested Vitamin D3 and increasing veggies in the diet. Well, my D3 level is 70, and I eat tons of organic veggies, no grains, no dairy, and only small amounts of organic meat.

I have had problems with spinal stenosis for about 10 years and have recently developed a fairly significant case of sciatica. My experience with Zolpidem Tartrate has been very good, so far. I've been taking it for about 6 months. I take 1/2 of a 10 mg. tablet at night before going to bed. I haven't noticed any disturbing side effects, in fact, I don't seem to have problems with restless leg syndrom any more. At my age I don't worry about an addiction to something like this as getting a decent night's rest/sleep is more important to me. I have tried Tylenol PM but I wake up feeling like a \"zombie\", my doctor recommended not using OTC sleep aids for that reason.Read More Read Less  \n",

It provides me with a restful nights sleep. I do not have any side effects at all. I get out of bed ready for the day. I have tried Trazadone, it did not work. I have tried Doxipin, it didn't work either and as a side effect I had uncontrollable hunger. We are all different and our bodies process things differently.

I think they did, and so that will help, I hope..I was  put on Ambien in 2004. I am still on it, and it does help turn off the switch, but now I am extremely addicted to the drug. I have seen many doctors, done sleep studies, and tried other sleep and anti anxiety meds. None have helped. I have chronic severe pain, and fibromyalgia. I exercise dailt, eat right, dont smoke, dont drink. I am at a good weight. My warning to all? I now have been diagnosed with mild cognitve impairment. I am 44, and a college graduate. It is now physically impossible to fall asleep without this drug. I have tried many many times. I cannot even nap.. I am always tired, nauseous, and have many memory issues.

I was taking 450 mgs of Trazodone and was still not sleeping well. I have also tryed to stop drinking anything after 7pm so I don't have to pee in the middle of the night. I have never tryed any kind of sleep aid in my life, I was taking the Trazodone for depression but I love this medication. If I do wake up I can go back to sleep within minutes. Before I would have to take a couple of melatonin to fall back to sleep. It has also taken away my Restless leg syndrome so I no longer have to take medication for that!
