Ann, 5/2/2019 ,This Medicine has saved my life.  I had no quality of life before it. ,
Bear Man, 2/9/2019 ,I've been taking 12.5extended release for about 4 yrs.I fall asleep within 1/2hr and sleep for 8-10 hrs of continuous deep sleep.,
squid, 1/25/2019 ,"I have taken (10 mg)for about two years. On an empty stomach, it works to get me to sleep but I often wake after 6 hours or so. Sometimes I can get back to sleep. Often feel drowsy the next morning. I fell getting out of bed and landed on my back the other night. I don't remember the fall (my wife told me). I have started to cut the pills in half to slowly get off the ambien. 5 MG still helps me get to sleep now and I hope to get completely off it.",
",ippdr", 1/23/2019 ,take it on an empty stomach and don't do anything except lay in bed.  don't scroll thru Facebook posting comments.  just sleep,
PeaceByPiecing, 1/16/2019 ,"This was prescribed as I was simultaneously going through a divorce and menopause,  immediately followed by diagnosis of kidney cancer and a nephrectomy.  Love, Health, Money; entire life in a turmoil.  At first, it was as needed, and then I needed it every night.  I now take 10 mg nightly.  Most nights, I sleep straight through 8 hours and wake refreshed and...pleasant as opposed to snarly.  I feel well rested.  It's been over a decade now and this drug works for me every single night, every time.  I am dependent on it.    There is a routine that needs to be followed (for me).  Brush teeth, wash face, get pajamas on, get my favorite book and curl up in bed.  No binge eating, sleep walking or (heaven forbid) sleep driving.  I prefer to call this dependence rather than addiction and perhaps that is just semantics.  I am unable to fall asleep without this drug.  I have never  abused it; I simply follow directions and take it as prescribed.  For me, this drug has meant the difference between tossing and turning all night long to at least 7-8 hours of restful sleep.    ",
Sleep walking sleep driving, 12/25/2018 ,"Started taking Ambien after starting EMSAM patch for depression which made it impossible to sleep. Awake for 3 days sometimes. Ambien gave the side effect of sleep walking, not remembering in the morning. Only partial success getting/staying asleep. Sleep walking and sleep driving an issue, and dangerous.",
Grinchy49, 11/15/2018 ,"I창??ve been on generic Ambien for about 5 years. If I didn창??t take it, I didn창??t fall asleep. I called to get a refill and I was told by my doctor창??s office that the drug is now a level 2 and it should not be taken long term, especially for people over 65, which I am. They recommended I take melatonin or they could prescribe something else. I looked online for reasons why long term was not good, ",
ZZIMMK, 11/12/2018 ,ENERGY CHILL LIKE BUD WITHOUT MUNCHIES and worrying...good sexual ability...word,
ambien, 10/9/2018 ,"Taken this drug for 15 yrs. or so. NOT a good drug! as I get older, side effects are greater, short term memory, coginance, will to socialize,anxiety, etc.(full headuness?) all day. Do NOT take this med. Think it is addictive (Got to sleep) Am trying now, has kept me from doing many things (family, appts., social events ",
wac, 9/28/2018 ,I've taken ambien for over 5 years and it always puts me to sleep within half an hour if taken on an empty stomach. I do wake up twice a night to use the bathroom but can easily get back to sleep. Feel refreshed in the morning. Only side effect is it makes me feel very hungry during my bathroom breaks but I've learned to ignore that and just go back to sleep.,
Jodoc, 9/24/2018 ,Recommend dosage for my age. Is nauseas a side effect ,
Anonymous, 9/13/2018 ,"I've been on zolpidem for 8 years. I started at 5mg and am now on the 12.5 CR dose. I do not sleep if I don't take it. I have concerns about being in it for this long and concerns about reports if an increased risk of dementia as I get older. Melatonin does not work for me. Trazadone made me nauseous and dizzy. I would like to lower my dose back to the 10mg and see if I can wean off and try something else. But overall, Ambien is amazing if you can't sleep.",
Anonymous, 5/30/2018 ,My wife has taken this drug for some time. The sleep walking is really bad but the verbal abuse is frightening.,
Time2godaddy, 5/30/2018 ,"I have an unknown side effect using Ambien. It does it job in helping me go to sleep which is wonderful, but I do what my dr. calls: ""Ambien shopping"" and this is the 1st time he's heard of it. I never wear jewelry except my wedding ring, but when I take Ambien I will get up in the middle of the night, get on the internet and buy jewelry; a LOT of jewelry. I don't realize what I've done until the UPS man shows up at my door with my packages. At least I look for 'Sales"" and ""closeouts"". I've decided to keep the jewelry and save it for my grand daughter's inheritance.  ",
Get OFF AMBIEN, 5/14/2018 ,Are these positive reviews being created by the DRUG COMPANY? I took for 4 years. This drug is TERRIBLE DRUG. GET OF IT! Be prepared withdrawal symptoms are BAD but stay with it. You'll feel great again.,
Anonymous, 1/23/2018 ,"I have been taking Ambian for 6 years. I was always in a constant state of worry and sleep was hard to come by. With Ambian I get a decent 6 or 7  hours of sleep a night. I hope that I'm not addicted to it, but I think I am. ",
wmoskowitz, 10/7/2017 ,zolpidem has been substituted for brand name and does not work at all.,
Oma, 9/11/2017 ,"My doctor is hesitant to prescribe this for me and keeps warning me about it.  I only use it when I am flying across the Atlantic ocean between the U.S. and Europe.  Without it, I cannot sleep at all while crammed into that seat on an airplane in coach.  With one 5 mg tablet I can sleep 3-5 hours, which is much better than going without sleep for a total of 36 hours.  I don't feel groggy; and I have enough energy to go sightseeing all day after arriving.  I have not yet experienced any side effects, no sleepwalking, no memory loss, no mind fog.  A healthier solution would be to fly first class, but then I could not afford to travel to Europe two or three times per year, and I have two granddaughters there.  ",
KenW, 9/3/2017 ,"I am a shift worker and have a fluctuating sleep schedule. For me, Ambien lasts about 4-5 hours and then I am awake. Those that say make sure to get at least 8 hours, well that's their experience, not mine. It does work rather quickly though.",
Katy  Kelly, 5/15/2017 ,Love this drug. Been on it for 10 years or more. No side affects. Wake up feel good. Never drowsy or tired. Great. Couldn't and didn't sleep without it. ,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-9690-ambien-oral?conditionid=&sortval=1&page=3&next_page=true
